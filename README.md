# **ABOUT**

**UniNav** Platform is a collaborative, student-driven application designed to help university students easily access and download essential course-related materials, organized by Faculty and Department. The platform streamlines the process of discovering and exploring resources such as course outlines, schemes of work, past exam questions, and other study materials contributed by students for the benefit of their peers and future students.

Students are not just consumers but active contributors, uploading study materials to their Google Drive accounts and sharing access through the platform. This fosters a community-driven approach where current and past students can help each other by making valuable resources available to everyone in their department or course.

By leveraging these shared materials and integrating a recommendation algorithm, the platform provides personalized suggestions based on a user’s academic profile, interests, and the materials explored by students in similar courses. This ensures that new students, or those transitioning to new levels, can quickly familiarize themselves with the required study materials, eliminating the hassle of searching for resources during the critical first weeks of the semester.

Recommendations Engine: The platform provides tailored recommendations on materials to explore, based on user profile, academic interests, and similar students’ exploration patterns.

Collaborative Contributions: Current and past students can contribute by uploading new materials to their Google Drive, which are then indexed and made available to other students for easy access.
Search & Filtering: A powerful search functionality allows students to quickly find specific materials by filtering results by session, course type, or material type.

User-Friendly Interface: The platform features an intuitive user interface built with React, allowing students to navigate easily across faculties and departments, with dynamic content loading and minimal friction.
